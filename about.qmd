## Overview

Our project's role is to help by using our expertise in GIS to support disaster relief planning. By integrating the limited open government data and other open-source data sets, we can anticipate demand for emergency services and help optimise how responders deploy their scarce resources.

## Objectives

Our project's objectives are:

1\. Analyse population density of Derna's residential areas

2\. Assess site suitability for disaster responders to use as evacuation centers

3\. Examine service area and accessibility of evacuation and healthcare facilities after the disaster

#### About Derna and the Flood

The City of Derna (population of 90,000) in northeastern Libya (east of Benghazi) sits on the Mediterranean Coast and is bisected by the Wadi Derna, a seasonal river protected by dams. On 10 September 2023, Storm Daniel caused a major dam collapse, displacing tens of thousands from their homes and triggering a huge humanitarian crisis.
