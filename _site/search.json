    "text": "Overview\nThe City of Derna (population of 90,000) in northeastern Libya (east of Benghazi) sits on the Mediterranean Coast and is bisected by the Wadi Derna, a seasonal river protected by dams. On 10 September 2023, Storm Daniel caused a major dam collapse, displacing tens of thousands from their homes and triggering a huge humanitarian crisis.\nOur project’s role is to help by using our expertise in GIS to support disaster relief planning. By integrating the limited open government data and other open-source data sets, we can anticipate demand for emergency services and help optimise how responders deploy their scare resources."

    "text": "Results and Discussion\nIn conclusion, the collapse of Derna's dams has caused irreparable damage to Derna, with many of its citizens losing their lives as well as their homes in the catastrophe.\nTo make sure such an incident does not become a catastrophe in the future, it is imperative to ensure that Derna is well equipped to handle such floods, with proper planning of their future buildings.\nWith regards to residential or apartment buildings, in the future, these buildings should be built further from the coast. The current concentration of citizens near the coast, as illuminated by the maps, shows the vulnerability of these coastal communities to flood-related hazards. By strategically designing future residential or apartment buildings further inland, urban planners can contribute to a more resilient Derna. This planning seeks to reduce the human and infrastructural toll of flooding, fostering a safer and more sustainable living environment. Moreover, dispersing residential areas away from flood-prone zones aligns with principles of disaster risk reduction, offering a solution to reduce the impact of potential flood events. This new layout of buildings will also lead to a greater cost effectiveness when allocating resources to people affected by future floods. With fewer individuals situated in flood-prone areas, the demand for evacuation resources is likely to diminish, resulting in a more efficient and targeted allocation of emergency response teams, evacuation routes, and relief supplies.\nWith regards to health facilities and evacuation centres, future facilities and centres should be built at places that are outside flood prone areas, but at the same time, be accessible to people that are within these flood prone areas. In charting the course for future health facilities and evacuation centres, a priority should be assigned to locations that guarantee unimpeded access for individuals residing in flood-prone areas. This placement is designed not only to mitigate the impact of potential floods on the functionality of these facilities but, more importantly, to ensure that residents in high-risk zones have swift and convenient access to healthcare and evacuation services during emergencies. Furthermore, as shown by the accessibility map above, there is a lack of accessibility to those services even at places not near the coastline but are affected by the floods. When building future facilities or centres, priority should be given to better serve these people and provide them with better care in the event of a flood.\nLastly, with regards to other important infrastructure such as water and power plants, future placements of these buildings should take into consideration the slope analysis map shown above. By placing these critical infrastructure at places with higher elevation, it reduces the risk of things such as electricity and fresh water being not available during future crises. Having these important basic necessities in times of disaster could prove very beneficial for the citizens of Derna and can increase their resilience to such disasters.\n\n\nFuture considerations\nTo broaden the scope of our investigation and foster a more comprehensive call-to-action, several considerations can be made.\nFirstly, the adoption of smaller hexagonal sizes for future analysis might prove to be more valuable. Given Derna’s relatively compact size as a town, employing smaller hexagons offers increased precision in capturing the small details of the population distribution and flood risk, contributing to a more accurate and detailed assessment.\nSecondly, the use of satellite imagery and field data should be used to better increase the precision of determining whether a building is considered a residential or apartment building. By having greater accuracy in determining building type, we are then able to get a better gauge of Derna's population density per hexagon. This would allow for more precise and effective planning of future resources.\nLastly, when considering locations of future health facilities, the north-west part of Derna should be given some consideration. Currently, the people at the north-west region of Derna lack access to these facilities and would benefit from having a health facility in the form of a clinic or hospital being built there."

    "text": "Lessons learnt\nFrom this project, we learned that it is important to consider scale when determining our scope of investigation. Despite Derna being a small city, it seemed that the 250m hexagon map was sufficient to cover our study area and reflect the trends of population density and accessibility that we investigated. However, as mentioned in our future considerations, our analysis could have benefitted from a more precise map using smaller hexagon sizes as our features of focus within Derna were also smaller and more densely packed than we anticipated.\nFurthermore, as Derna's datasets were not extensive nor fully-detailed, we had to learn how to make best-guess estimates and manually clean the data using our knowledge on-hand about Derna. For example, since Derna didn't have official data on its population density across the city, we decided to use residential buildings as an estimate of where people would be. As mentioned above, we also had to make informed guesses and reference satellite data when determining which unclassified building polygons were actually residential buildings. Though these may yield less accurate findings, making these informed estimations based on existing data allowed us to observe and map the trends of residents' accessibility to evacuation centres.\nLastly, we recognised the importance of GIS technology in providing the government and external humanitarian aid services an analytical view of Derna for flood mitigation measures. The areas we identified as being poor in accessibility to both evacuation centres and healthcare facilities could be prioritised, better focusing humanitarian aid efforts to create more efficient processes for post-flood mitigation. Visualising the extensive areas of high flood risk in Derna could motivate their government to better maintain their dams, as well as set up infrastructure in less-accessible areas for shelter and healthcare."

    "text": "For the population density map, we used residential and apartment buildings as a gauge for the population density of Derna falls under. For buildings that were unclassified, we took a look at the satellite imagery of Derna and found a building that was classified as a residential/apartment building and used its area as a gauge to classify the unclassified buildings as residential/apartment buildings or not.\nThe choropleth map provides an insight into the distribution of Derna’s population in relation to flood risk areas, highlighting a significant concentration of residents in close proximity to the coastline, within areas susceptible to flooding. This spatial pattern shows the urgency and importance of strategic planning for potential flood-related emergencies in the region.\nIn the event of a flood, it is imperative to allocate resources effectively. The map can serve as a valuable guide in determining the allocation of resources for evacuation and disaster preparedness. It is crucial to prioritise areas with darker shaded hexagons. These areas necessitate a more substantial allocation of resources, including emergency response teams, evacuation routes and relief supplies, to ensure the safety and well-being of a greater proportion of the population.\n\n\nIn Derna's context as a small rural town, repurposing existing buildings as evacuation centres is a more practical option to building permanent shelters – which may be costly and are largely space-inefficient. Schools and universities were thus chosen as primary evacuation centres, as they tend to have large sheltered halls which minimises the extra effort to protect from weather conditions, and sanitation amenities are already installed in the buildings for convenience and maintaining hygiene. \n\n\nHowever, the sites have to be assessed for their risk of being flooded to ascertain that they will be fit as evacuation centres. As Derna is a generally low-lying city with large areas of flatland near its coastal edge, we decided to rank the suitability of areas for evacuation and safety based on elevation level. \nBy retrieving Derna's Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and using QGIS's Zonal Statistics raster analysis function, we extracted the summary statistics of elevation within the flood extent area (with reference to the DEM). We then used these values to rank the flood risk of different elevation levels across Derna as seen in the map above. \nRed areas are the lowest-lying coastal areas which are most likely to be affected by future floods based on the previous flood level. Green and blue areas further inland have higher elevation and thus are less prone to flooding, making them safer and better suited as evacuation centres to house the displaced population. Hence, based on visual analysis of the rank-coloured DEM layer, we eliminated school buildings that were within the highest areas of risk (denoted by red areas). We also eliminated venues that were moderately affected (denoted by yellow areas) to account for any unforeseen rises in future flood levels.\nThis leaves 14 viable school sites for the displaced residents, covering both areas on the north and south sides of the Wadi Derna main river (seen denoted as the yellow stream cutting through Derna). Given that the sites should be able to avoid major infrastructural damage from flooding due to being on higher land, the functioning amenities, sanitation, and shelter would greatly aid displaced residents in recovering as they wait for the flood to recede and return to their homes. \n\nThe accessibility choropleth was intended for usage one or two days after flooding hit Derna city.

    "text": "For the population density map, we used residential and apartment buildings as a gauge for the population density of Derna falls under. For buildings that were unclassified, we took a look at the satellite imagery of Derna and found a building that was classified as a residential/apartment building and used its area as a gauge to classify the unclassified buildings as residential/apartment buildings or not.\nThe choropleth map provides an insight into the distribution of Derna’s population in relation to flood risk areas, highlighting a significant concentration of residents in close proximity to the coastline, within areas susceptible to flooding. This spatial pattern shows the urgency and importance of strategic planning for potential flood-related emergencies in the region.\nIn the event of a flood, it is imperative to allocate resources effectively. The map can serve as a valuable guide in determining the allocation of resources for evacuation and disaster preparedness. It is crucial to prioritise areas with darker shaded hexagons. These areas necessitate a more substantial allocation of resources, including emergency response teams, evacuation routes and relief supplies, to ensure the safety and well-being of a greater proportion of the population.\n\n\nIn Derna's context as a small rural town, repurposing existing buildings as evacuation centres is a more practical option to building permanent shelters – which may be costly and are largely space-inefficient. Schools and universities were thus chosen as primary evacuation centres, as they tend to have large sheltered halls which minimises the extra effort to protect from weather conditions, and sanitation amenities are already installed in the buildings for convenience and maintaining hygiene. \n\n\nHowever, the sites have to be assessed for their risk of being flooded to ascertain that they will be fit as evacuation centres. As Derna is a generally low-lying city with large areas of flatland near its coastal edge, we decided to rank the suitability of areas for evacuation and safety based on elevation level. \nBy retrieving Derna's Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and using QGIS's Zonal Statistics raster analysis function, we extracted the summary statistics of elevation within the flood extent area (with reference to the DEM). We then used these values to rank the flood risk of different elevation levels across Derna as seen in the map above. \nRed areas are the lowest-lying coastal areas which are most likely to be affected by future floods based on the previous flood level. Green and blue areas further inland have higher elevation and thus are less prone to flooding, making them safer and better suited as evacuation centres to house the displaced population. Hence, based on visual analysis of the rank-coloured DEM layer, we eliminated school buildings that were within the highest areas of risk (denoted by red areas). We also eliminated venues that were moderately affected (denoted by yellow areas) to account for any unforeseen rises in future flood levels.\nThis leaves 14 viable school sites for the displaced residents, covering both areas on the north and south sides of the Wadi Derna main river (seen denoted as the yellow stream cutting through Derna). Given that the sites should be able to avoid major infrastructural damage from flooding due to being on higher land, the functioning amenities, sanitation, and shelter would greatly aid displaced residents in recovering as they wait for the flood to recede and return to their homes. \n\nThe accessibility choropleth was intended for usage one or two days after flooding hit Derna city. As such, while using QNEAT3, we assumed that the flooding would have decreased by then and the road network in the flooded area is usable. Furthermore, we used the shortest distance in the OD Matrix as we assumed that as this is a time of emergency, vehicles should be able to travel as fast as they would want to reach the health facilities or evacuation centres and as such, we chose to neglect the speed limit of these roads. Lastly, we chose to give a higher priority to health care facilities as compared to evacuation centres when creating the final ranking of accessibility. This is because we placed more importance on getting people the medical attention they needed as compared to getting people to shelters when their houses were destroyed. \nThe accessibility landscape in Derna city predominantly exhibits a moderate level of accessibility, with specific regions facing notably lower degrees of accessibility to healthcare facilities and evacuation centres.
